# T.R.A.I.N

It is designed to take train timetable data from [NaPTAN](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/naptan) and display it in the app.

The data is processed through an intermediary server before being delivered to the client.

This app was built by a team during the University of Nottingham tech varsity event against Nottingham Trent.

The iOS programming was done by me, the server by another team member and the design/graphics were done by another two team members.

Both teams were given the same brief and in the end, our app was deemed the victor by the judges.

## Running

Unfortunately, although the app should compile and run, the server isn't operational so there isn't currently any functionality.
